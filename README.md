### Installation

To run the program you need:
* Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or newer
* jbcrypt.jar, AbsoluteLayout.jar and beansbinding-1.2.1.jar (in lib diirectory)
* FileLoader package (in top directory)
* MyHiLO.jar (in top directory)

Download these files to a directory on your computer. Strongly recommended that you use a directory **without any spaces in the path**.

**TODO** Put all the files the user needs in a directory named "dist"

#### Using Apple
   **[Download](https://github.com/darmonlyone/MyHighLowGame/releases)** >> *HighLow.zip*
   - Extract HighLow.zip file

   - **Run** MyHiLO.exe
     
#### Any Operating System
Suppose you have downloaded the files to a directory named /home/username/games. Then add these files to classpath and run the main class of game using:
```shell
cmd>  java -cp '/home/username/games/*' myhilo.MainRun
```
You must write the directory (path) in quotes to prevent processing of "\*" by the shell interpretter.

## Why Make This Game
The application is made for an OOP project in part of Software and Knowledge Engineering (Kasetsart University). We make
the application to show how much we can do from learning in this course. We use many things from this course to write the
application like using an Array, ArrayList, Method, Class, FileLoader, FileWriter or even a basic programing. **We hope
very much for your guy to enjoy this application.**
